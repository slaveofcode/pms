# Voodio (Private Media Server)
Voodio is a Simple Private Media Server based on your local Movie Directories. It just a simple program doing tracking on your "Movies" folder, create an index and showing the movies via Web UI to play streamly through the browser.

## Background
I always wanted to watch my old movie collection that saved on my external hardisk or on my PC drive. But unfortunately I'am too lazy to open my computer, starting to crawl and watch those movies. I always wonder if I could see those movies as a Website through my Home network (LAN), click the detail and play, like I'm watching on the Netfl*x (but using a browser :P).

## Yo Warning!
This project is experimental, the application will be doing some transcoding process of the selected video file, also it will consuming your CPU usage (yeah, because your computer is being a server now). The available space on your *OS cache path* location is also decreased for a temporary, to store a ***.ts** files for playing the video on browser. **Please consider this behavior before running it on your computer.**

## Application Behavior
This application will need extra space like **8-10x** of the played video which extracted from FFmpeg transcoding/transmuxing process of **HLS** files, the space needed could be lower if there a less available resolution to generate (like only for 480p or 720p), then you can play it streamly through your local network with your favourite device via any **Browser**. The space used through this operation will be cleand up after the server is turned of (killed), it basically will be immediatelly deletes all the generated HLS files so you get free space again.

## Installation

### Have FFMPEG installed on your OS or at least you have the Binary

Visit [FFmpeg Official Download](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) page to install based on your current OS, or just get the executable binary. FFmpeg is available for **Windows**, **Mac** and **Linux**. Please use FFmpeg with version **4.0** or better with version **3.*** (already tested).

FFmpeg with version **>= 4.1** had an issue of immediatelly generate playlist file (**.m3u8**). When transcoding process is running, it doesn't update periodically for *.m3u8 file about generated *.ts files, I don't know exactly why that's happen, but I think there's a solution for that, just need a more time to figure it out.

### Using Precompiled Binary (Recommended)

Go to the prebuilt binary on the [release section here](https://github.com/slaveofcode/voodio/releases), depending on what your OS 

### Using Go Get

    // install it via go get
    go get github.com/slaveofcode/voodio

    // run the binary with path to the parent of video directories from your module binary path
    // options for port and ffmpeg-bin are optional
    GOPATH/bin/voodio -port 8080 -tmdb-key <your-tmdb-key> -ffmpeg-bin /path/to/ffmpeg -path /path/to/videos -resolution 720p -resolution 480p

If the configuration and steps above is complete, you can heads up to http://[your-ip-host-or-localhost]:8080 on your browser to start select the movie and generate HLS first before starting to watch.

### Options

- `-path` The full path of the video directory
- `-tmdb-key` API key of TMDB, you can grab one at [Official TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- `-port` (optional) The port number for the server to run, default to 1818
- `-resolution` (optional) By default the program will produce 4 resolution (360p, 480p, 720p and 1080p), this option can be supplied multiple times
